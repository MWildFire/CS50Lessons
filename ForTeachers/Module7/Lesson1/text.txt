So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in
Drop dead a bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
Three times casino eviction
Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me what would you say
I'd say its up, to me
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in
Ignorance and Understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left? To start the pleading
How far will we take this
It's not hard to see through the sickness
